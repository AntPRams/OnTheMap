# OnTheMap

A project required by Udacity that serves the purpose of sharing our location with other students and having access to theirs.
The project was approved for the 4th module of the course.


## Getting Started

This is the project of the 4th module in the Udacity iOS Dev Nanodegree to atest our capabilities of dealing with JSON requests and responses and with asynchronous programming

The app uses the Udacity API to share and receive the location of 100 students (limited by the query in the url located in EndPoints `static let sortedParam = "?order=-updatedAt&limit=100"`)
The data shared in this application is randomly generated by the Udacity server, **which means that personal data will never be shared**

The intentionality of the project served to learn how to communicate with an API and to make requests and dealing with responses through coding and decoding JSON blocks. The HTTP methods used are `GET`, `POST`, `PUT` and `DELETE`

## UI Details

<img src=Images/OTMScreens.png>

- **Login Screen**: Here we sign in or signup through Udacity

- **Students Location**: A map generated through the Apple MapKit framework in which the results are presented through a custom pin, clicking on the pin displays an annotation that gives access to the student's (fictitious) name and the URL he shared, if click on annotation we are forwarded to Safari

- **Students List**: Exactly the same as the Students Location but here the results are presented in a TableView, the table is organized by the most recent shares

- **Share Location**: A screen that also uses the framework `MapKit` and through foward geocoding we can just write down the name of the city and confirm our location, after this the app asks for a URL to share with the other students. By placing Submit we are directed to the location that we choose in the Students Location screen or, if the last screen was the Students List, the tableview will be automatically updated 

The code also has a `MainViewController` with all the properties, buttons and methods used by more than one ViewController, the idea was to encapsulate them to avoid repetitions in the remaining controllers and to leave the code cleaner


### Prerequisites

Mac OS X 10.14

xCode 10.xx


### Installing

Use **Git Clone** to copy the project:

```

git clone https://github.com/lArdevlp/OnTheMap.git
cd ../OnTheMap
open OnTheMap.xcodeproj

```


## Know issues 


- The url check is not working (see line 99 in `AddLocationController`), the method is very poor and the user can easely add a fake URL

- ~~The button in the top right corner of the Students List/Location serves to add a location, if you already shared a location is it supposed that button changes its image to a more intuitive one. This happens only if you change views (between Students Location and List). When you add a location for the first time and dismissing the `AddLocationController` with the sumission of your location, the present controller will not update the button image automatically~~ -fixed 7/7/19
