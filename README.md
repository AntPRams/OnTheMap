# OnTheMap

A app to share your location with your classmates that study at Udacity


## Getting Started

This is the project of the 4th module in the Udacity iOS Dev Nanodegree to atest our capabilities of dealing with JSON requests and responses and with asynchronous programming

The app uses the Udacity API to share and receive the location of 100 students (limited by the query in the url located in EndPoints `static let sortedParam = "?order=-updatedAt&limit=100"`)
The data shared in this application is randomly generated by the Udacity server, which means that personal data will never be shared

The intentionality of the project served to learn how to communicate as an API and to make requests and responses through coding and decoding JSON blocks. The HTTP methods used are GET, POST, PUT and DELETE


**The app has 4 screens;**


- **Login Screen**: Here we sign in or signup through Udacity

- **Students Location**: A map generated through the Apple MapKit framework in which the results are presented through a custom pin, clicking on the pin displays an annotation that gives access to the student's (fictitious) name and the URL he shared, if click on annotation we are forwarded to Safari

- **Students List**: Exactly the same as the Students Location but here the results are presented in a TableView, the table is organized by the most recent shares

- **Share Location**: A screen that also uses the framework `MapKit` and through foward geocoding we can just put the city and confirm our location, after this the app asks for a URL to share. By placing Submit we are directed to the location that we chose in the Students Location screen or, if the last screen was the Students List, the tableview will be automatically updated 

The code also has a `MainViewController` with all the properties, buttons and methods used by more than one ViewController, the idea was to encapsulate to avoid repetitions in the remaining controllers and to leave the code cleaner


### Prerequisites

Mac OS X 10.14

xCode 10.xx


### Installing

Use **Git Clone** to copy the project:

```

git clone https://github.com/lArdevlp/OnTheMap.git
cd ../OnTheMap
open OnTheMap.xcodeproj

```


## Know issues 

*The purpose of these repositories are to track my progress and so that later I can apply my know how to achieve them, that is, these issues will not be fixed by me in the next couple of months*

- The url check is not working (see line 99 in `AddLocationController`), the method is very poor and the user can easely add a fake URL

- The button in the top right of the Students List/Location serves to add a location, if you already shared a location is it supposed that button changes its image to a more intuitive one. This happens only if you change views (between Students Location and List). When you add a location for the first time, when dismissing the `AddLocationController` the controller where you at will not update the button image automatically
